## Architecture Overview

This is an Angular 18 application for managing futsal team generation, player statistics, and match attendance. The application integrates with Google Sheets as a backend data store through Firebase Functions.

### Core Components Structure

- **Team Generator** (`src/app/components/team-generator/`) - Generates balanced futsal teams based on player ratings and positions
- **Leaderboard** (`src/app/components/leaderboard/`) - Displays player rankings, statistics, and team chemistry analysis  
- **Attendance** (`src/app/components/attendance/`) - Manages player attendance for matches
- **Kalender** (`src/app/components/kalender/`) - Calendar view for players to mark availability
- **Wedstrijden** (`src/app/components/wedstrijden/`) - Match management and history
- **Score** (`src/app/components/score/`) - Score entry and match result tracking

### Key Services

- **GoogleSheetsService** - Handles all Google Sheets API integration via Firebase Functions
- **PlayerService** - Manages player data and statistics
- **TeamGenerateService** - Core team balancing algorithms
- **AttendanceService** - Player attendance management
- **WedstrijdenService** - Match data operations
- **GameStatisticsService** - Player performance analytics
- **NotificationService** - Manages Web Push notifications and browser subscription handling

### Data Architecture

The app uses Google Sheets as the primary data store with these main sheets:
- **Spelers** - Player information, ratings, and statistics
- **Wedstrijden** - Match data and results
- **Aanwezigheid** - Player attendance records
- **LaatsteTeams** - Latest generated team compositions
- **Notificaties** - Push notification subscription data and player preferences

### Key Interfaces

All TypeScript interfaces are centralized in `src/app/interfaces/`:
- `IPlayer.ts` - Player data structure
- `IWedstrijd.ts` - Match data structure
- `ITeam.ts` - Team composition structure
- `IAttendance.ts` - Attendance tracking structure

### Design Principles

- **Follow Angular Material UX guidelines as closely as possible** — use Material Design patterns, components, and conventions
- Prefer Angular Material components over custom implementations
- Navigation drawer (sidenav) headers should show app branding (logo + name), not generic labels like "Menu"
- Toolbar layout follows Material Design: hamburger left, title/logo centered on mobile, actions right
- Refer to [Material Design guidelines](https://m2.material.io/) for UX decisions when in doubt

### Styling

- Uses Angular Material with custom color scheme (not standard theme)
- **IMPORTANT: Always check `src/styles_variables.scss` for color definitions before adding new styles**
- Custom color palette defined in `src/styles_variables.scss`:
  - Primary color: `#1976d2` (blue)
  - Secondary color: `#616161` (grey)
  - Success color: `#43a047` (green)
  - Error color: `#f44336` (red)
- Global styles and imports are in `src/styles.scss`
- Component-specific styles follow Angular's encapsulated styling approach
- **When creating new components or styling, always use the variables from `styles_variables.scss` instead of hardcoding colors**

### Google Sheets Integration

The Firebase Functions backend (referenced as `firebaseBaseUrl` in environment) provides:
- `getSheetData` - Retrieve sheet data
- `appendSheetRow` - Add new rows
- `updateSheetRow` - Update existing rows  
- `batchUpdateSheet` - Bulk operations
- `querySheetData` - Filtered data queries

Always skip header rows when processing Google Sheets data (first row contains column headers).

### Deployment

- Build output goes to `dist/browser/` (see angular.json)
- CNAME file in `src/CNAME` is copied to build for custom domain
- Uses `angular-cli-ghpages` for GitHub Pages deployment
- Service Worker configured for PWA functionality

### Environment Configuration

- Environment files are in `src/environments/`
- `firebaseBaseUrl` must be configured for Google Sheets integration
- See `.example` files for required environment variables

### Testing

- Uses Jasmine/Karma for unit tests
- Protractor for E2E testing
- Test files follow `*.spec.ts` naming convention
